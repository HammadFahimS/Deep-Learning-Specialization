# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Repository

Welcome to my Neural Networks and Deep Learning course repository! This repository contains all of the assignments and projects completed during the course offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. This course taught me how to build, train, and deploy deep learning models for various applications.

## About the Course

The Neural Networks and Deep Learning course is part of Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization. It is an excellent introduction to the fundamentals of neural networks and their applications in deep learning. Throughout the course, I've gained hands-on experience with topics including logistic regression, shallow neural networks, deep neural networks, and more.

## Getting Started

To explore the assignments and projects in this repository, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Each assignment and project is organized into its directory corresponding to the week, making it easy to navigate and review the code and accompanying documentation.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (optional, depending on the assignments)

Happy learning!

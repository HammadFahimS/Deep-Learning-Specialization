### Deep Learning Specialization

#### Overview
Welcome to the "Deep Learning Specialization" repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting and storing my coursework, modules, and assignments from the Deep Learning Specialization offered by Deeplearning.AI and taught by Professor Andrew Ng. The specialization covers a wide array of deep learning topics and is designed to help learners gain practical knowledge and skills in neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning.

#### Specialization Structure
The Deep Learning Specialization consists of five courses, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
   - Introduction to deep learning
   - Neural network basics
   - Building deep neural networks
   - Practical aspects of deep learning

2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization**
   - Practical aspects of Deep Learning
   - Optimization algorithms
   - Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization, and Programming Frameworks

3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
   - Strategies to build machine learning projects
   - How to build a successful machine learning project
   - Project case studies

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
   - Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Deep convolutional models
   - Applications of convolutional networks

5. **Sequence Models**
   - Recurrent Neural Networks
   - Natural Language Processing & Word Embeddings
   - Sequence models & Attention mechanism

# Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the first coding assignment for Week 4 of the *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course by *Deeplearning.AI*. The assignment focuses on building a deep neural network from scratch, step by step, to gain a deeper understanding of the foundational concepts of neural network architectures.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this assignment are:

1. **Implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.**
2. **Use these functions to build a deep learning model for binary classification.**
3. **Understand the concept behind deep learning techniques such as L-layer neural networks.**
4. **Learn how to initialize and update parameters during training.**

## Files Included
- `Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step implementation.

## Implementation Steps

The notebook guides through several key steps in building a deep neural network:

1. **Initialize the parameters** for an L-layer neural network.
2. **Implement the forward propagation module** (shown in linear forward -> linear activation forward).
3. **Complete the linear part of a layer's forward propagation**.
4. **Use the activation function** (ReLU or Sigmoid).
5. **Combine the previous steps** into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] forward function.
6. **Stack the [LINEAR->RELU] forward function L-1 time (for layers 1 through L-1)** and add a [LINEAR->SIGMOID] at the end (for the final layer L).
7. **Compute the loss**.
8. **Implement the backward propagation module**.
9. **Update the parameters** using gradient descent.

## Concepts Utilized

- Forward Propagation
- Backward Propagation
- Parameter Updates
- Activation Functions
- Cost Functions
- Model Optimization and Training

## Environment and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook in an environment that supports IPython notebooks (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab).
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the steps involved in building and training a deep neural network.

## Results

This assignment doesn't focus on a specific dataset but provides a fundamental framework to build any deep learning model for binary classification tasks. Users can adapt the code to their specific dataset by adjusting the network architecture and training loop as needed.
